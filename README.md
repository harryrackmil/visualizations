HexagonViz is a stochastic simulation of two companies with different advertising and public relations budgets expanding over time. Each company can choose to advertise to people who have never heard of their product, advertise to people who have heard of their product but neither brand, or advertise to people who have only heard of their competitor. Each action has a different cost, and they're trying to greedily maximize market share. People who have heard of both companies will be split proportionally to PR budget. Thus, a company with a slightly higher PR budget may discourage the other company from paying to advertise to their competitor's market. This results in a large market advantage for company A, though its PR budget is only 51% of the total.
